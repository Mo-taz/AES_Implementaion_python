# AES_Implementaion_python

The following code is a simple implementation for the AES cipher

# Currently :
- it takes input as a string of hexadecimal both the key and plain text
- key and plain text must be 128 bit (16 byte) 
- the output is also printed as a hexadecimal string

# TODO:
- extend the key length
- extend the plain text to any arbitrary size 
- accept key and plain as String not (hexa characters 0,............,f)
- print otput as String
